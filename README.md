# osu-teams-index

Search and find any team on osu!
The osu! website does not currently have a team search function, you may use this tool for now:
https://xalib16.github.io/osu-teams-index/

- New teams data will be added to [global-teams-data.json](https://github.com/xalib16/osu-teams-index/edit/main/global-teams-data.json) daily, which will be displayed on [this github preview site](https://xalib16.github.io/osu-teams-index/).
- Amount of teams currently listed: **195**
- Goal: **10,000** teams listed

**Here is a grid preview (zoomed in):**

### Searchable things:
- `#teamId` - The team id with # as a prefix
- Team name
- Team short name e.g. [ABCD] 
- Team leader username

## DISCLAIMER:
Over **10,000** teams already exist and it's not easy to keep track of certain things like the member count, application status, images, and whether the team was deleted. I will still check occasionally, but there are no guarantees.
