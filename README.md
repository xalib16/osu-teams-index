# osu-teams-index

Search and find any team on osu!
The osu! website does not currently have a team search function, you may use this tool for now:
https://xalib16.github.io/osu-teams-index/

- New teams data will be added to [global-teams-data.json](https://github.com/xalib16/osu-teams-index/edit/main/global-teams-data.json) from time to time, which will be displayed on [this github preview site](https://xalib16.github.io/osu-teams-index/).
  - **Feel free to use this data anywhere! I have no plans on deleting it.**
- Amount of teams currently listed: **3474**

### Searchable things:
- `#teamId` - The team id with # as a prefix
- Team name
- Team short name (4 characters max)
- Team leader username

**Here is a grid preview (zoomed in):**

## DISCLAIMER:
Over **10,000** teams have already been created and it's not easy to keep track of certain things like the member count, application status, images, leader username changes, and whether the team was deleted. I will still check occasionally, but there are no guarantees. For the least, you will be still able to find teams.
