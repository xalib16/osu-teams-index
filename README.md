# osu-teams-index

Search and find any team on osu!
The osu! website does not currently have a team search function, you may use this tool for now:
https://xalib16.github.io/osu-teams-index/

- Teams data will be added to [global-teams-data.json](https://github.com/xalib16/osu-teams-index/edit/main/global-teams-data.json) daily, which will be displayed on [this github preview site.](https://xalib16.github.io/osu-teams-index/).
  
Here is a preview:

## DISCLAIMER:
Over **10,000** teams already exist and it's not easy to keep track of certain things like the member count, application status, images, and whether the team was deleted. I will still check occasionally, but there are no guarantees.
